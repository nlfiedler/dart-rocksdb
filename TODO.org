** Near Term
*** DONE test the build on Ubuntu Linux
**** commands to set up a clean bionic64 vm
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
$ sudo apt-get install libgflags-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libsnappy-dev
$ sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libbz2-dev
$ sudo apt-get install liblz4-dev
$ sudo apt-get install libzstd-dev
#+END_SRC
*** TODO test the build on CentOS Linux
*** TODO test the build on Windows
*** TODO ensure adequate API documentation
*** TODO unit tests should clean up after themselves
*** TODO examples should clean up after themselves
*** TODO introduce a =CHANGELOG.md=
*** TODO test usage of the package on a bare system (only dart)
**** most likely need to install the compression libs
**** centos
**** macos
**** ubuntu
**** windows
*** TODO should include the compression libs as submodules
**** this would make the build process easier and less system-dependent
**** see =rust-rocksdb= for example of submodules and build process
*** TODO replace the =Makefile= with a better build system
**** https://pub.dev/packages/build_native looks promising
**** build_native might handle the Dart SDK inclusion as well
**** could also use build_native to build rocksdb static library
** Long Term
*** TODO likely need to use Git LFS for storing compiled binaries
*** TODO add support for backward iteration
*** TODO add support for bulk get/put
*** TODO add support for column families
*** TODO add support to get update sequence number
*** TODO add support for snapshots
