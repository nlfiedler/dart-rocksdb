* dart-rocksdb
** Near Term
*** TODO replace the =Makefile= with a better build system
**** https://pub.dev/packages/build_native looks promising
**** build_native might handle the Dart SDK inclusion as well
*** TODO should build rocksdb with =PORTABLE=1 make static_lib= to build a portable binary
*** TODO test the build on Windows
**** also test the examples, some have Unix paths like =/tmp=
*** TODO test the build on Ubuntu Linux
**** need to build rocksdb with zstd included
**** why build static lib versus shared lib?
**** is =-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI= compiler flag really needed?
*** TODO test the build on CentOS Linux
*** TODO examples all write to the same test database path
*** TODO fix the inconsistent indentation of the C++ code
**** =brew install clang-format=
**** install VS Code clang-format module
*** TODO fix all of the linter warnings in the Dart code
**** including the examples
*** TODO try using =build_native= to build rocksdb
**** Linux requires different compiler flags
*** TODO do like =rust-rocksdb= and include the compression libs as submodules
*** TODO look for ways to build the native parts automatically
**** maybe something like node-gyp and/or node-pre-gyp
*** TODO make the examples easy to run, maybe need their own directory and =pubspec.yaml=
*** TODO introduce a =CHANGELOG.md=
** Long Term
*** TODO add support for backward iteration
*** TODO add support for bulk get/put
*** TODO add support for column families
*** TODO add support to get update sequence number
*** TODO add support for snapshots
