* dart-rocksdb
** Near Term
*** TODO replace the =Makefile= with a better build system
**** https://pub.dev/packages/build_native looks promising
**** build_native might handle the Dart SDK inclusion as well
*** TODO test the build on Windows
**** also test the examples, some have Unix paths like =/tmp=
*** TODO test the build on Ubuntu Linux
**** need to build rocksdb with zstd included
**** why build static lib versus shared lib?
**** is =-D_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI= compiler flag really needed?
*** TODO test the build on CentOS Linux
*** TODO try using =build_native= to build rocksdb
**** Linux requires different compiler flags
*** TODO should include the compression libs as submodules
**** see =rust-rocksdb= for an example
*** TODO look for ways to build the native parts automatically
**** maybe something like node-gyp and/or node-pre-gyp
*** TODO ensure adequate API documentation
*** TODO unit tests should clean up after themselves
*** TODO examples should clean up after themselves
*** TODO introduce a =CHANGELOG.md=
** Long Term
*** TODO add support for backward iteration
*** TODO add support for bulk get/put
*** TODO add support for column families
*** TODO add support to get update sequence number
*** TODO add support for snapshots
