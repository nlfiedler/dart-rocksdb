* dart-rocksdb
** Near Term
*** TODO test the build on Windows
*** TODO ensure adequate API documentation
*** TODO unit tests should clean up after themselves
*** TODO examples should clean up after themselves
*** TODO should include the compression libs as submodules
**** this would make the build process easier and less system-dependent
**** see =rust-rocksdb= for example of submodules and build process
*** TODO replace the =Makefile= with a better build system
**** https://pub.dev/packages/build_native looks promising
**** build_native might handle the Dart SDK inclusion as well
**** could also use build_native to build rocksdb static library
** Long Term
*** TODO will need a release process that bundles the binaries
**** the =pub= command probably has a means of including binaries
**** test usage of the package on a bare system (only dart)
***** most likely need to install the compression libs
***** centos
***** macos
***** ubuntu
***** windows
*** TODO add support for backward iteration
*** TODO add support for bulk get/put
*** TODO add support for column families
*** TODO add support to get update sequence number
*** TODO add support for snapshots
